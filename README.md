Minesweeper
===========

Working version.

The rules in Minesweeper are simple:

Uncover a mine, and the game ends.

Uncover an empty square, and you keep playing.

Uncover a number, and it tells you how many mines lay hidden in the eight 
surrounding squaresâ€”information you use to deduce which nearby squares are safe to click.

To Flag a mine as being a mine, type "F" before the location of said mine.

The counter of mines will decrese for each flagged mine.

Hint:
If three squares in a row display 2-3-2, then you know 
three mines are probably lined up beside that row. If a 
square says 8, every surrounding square is mined.
